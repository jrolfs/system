// Rounded display corners: one overlay surface per monitor that paints the four little
// wedges the screen's corners would cut off if the panel were physically rounded. Purely
// cosmetic: the surface is click-THROUGH (empty input mask) and reserves no space, so it
// never steals a click or shoves a window around.
//
// Each corner is the same wedge shape rotated 0/90/180/270, so all four stay identical no
// matter the radius. Sits on the overlay layer so it rides above windows (including
// fullscreen ones) the way a real bezel would.
//
// A TV's panel is square to its bezel, so on one (irulan) Config.screenCorners belongs
// off: painted corners would only clip the picture.
